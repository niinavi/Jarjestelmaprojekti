## Project background
The topic of this project is to create a small architecture for centralized logging. Our aim is to familiarize our team with the tools, collect log data and analyze it. The project is part of our studies in ICT-infrastructure project course.

In this project we will use the collection of open source tools, Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (ELK Stack). Elasticsearch is the search engine and stores the data, Logstash processes the data and sends the data to Elasticseach and Kibana is a tool for visualization. We will use FileBeat to transfer the data to the Logstash server.

## Goals
- Collect, store, analyze and visualize log data with Logstash, Elasticsearch and Kibana
- Transfer log data from target machine with FileBeat to the Logstash server
- Control machines with SaltStack
- Apache web authentication for Kibana
- Attack the target machine to see results in log data and analyze it



## Communication and meetings
Our team will meet weekly to discuss and plan our progress. We will communicate via WhatsApp. We use Trello Kanban board for task management. Our work documentation will be stored in Github.
