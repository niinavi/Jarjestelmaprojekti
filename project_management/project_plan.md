## Project background
The topic of this project is to create a small architecture for centralized logging. Our aim is to familiarize our team with the tools, collect log data and analyze it. The project is part of our studies in ICT-infrastructure project course. 

Our team is interested in centralized log management and we think it is significant part of security and system operations. Our team does not have previous experience of the main components in the project.

In this project we will use the collection of open source tools, Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (ELK Stack). Elasticsearch is the search engine and stores the data, Logstash processes the data and sends the data to Elasticseach and Kibana is a tool for visualization. We will use FileBeat to transfer the data to Logstash. 

Our baseline for this project is centralized management system in company's local area network. If we have enough resources we can develop the project even further.

## Mission
The mission of this project, is to install tools for centralized log management and familiarize our team with them and log analyzing. 


## Goals and results
- Install ELK Stack components
- Transfer log data with FileBeat
- Collect, store, analyze and visualize log data
- Control machines with SaltStack
- interfere the target machine to see the results in log data and analyze it


The project documentations are project plan, progress report, final report and presentation and technical documentation and architecture model.
